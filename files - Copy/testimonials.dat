I recently had to have knee replacement surgery and
did my rehab at Choctaw Physical Therapy. The people there were always 
helpful and friendly. They made sure that I knew how to do each exercise 
and assisted me in any way needed. The folks there kept things going with 
a sense of humor even though they knew some of what was being done was 
painful for their patients. And you couldn't leave there with out some 
kind of feeling that you accomplished something good there after each 
session. I can highly recommend Choctaw Physical Therapy for anyone's 
rehab needs.

Choctaw, Ok.

I've been a patient at Choctaw Physical Therapy 
several times over the years, with great success each time. The staff there 
is friendly, knowledgeable and make your visits enjoyable. Derek, Shawn, Kelly 
and Carre all familiarize themselves with your injury. No matter which therapist 
you're working with, you feel like they remember your case. They encourage you 
to gently push yourself to your limit to expedite strengthening and healing. 
They're the best!!
