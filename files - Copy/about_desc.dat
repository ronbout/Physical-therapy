Choctaw Physical Therapy is an outpatient physical therapy clinic dedicated to overcoming your obstacles.

CHOCTAW PHYSICAL THERAPY was created in 2000 by a ownership group composed of two physical therapists and two physical therapy assistants.

The goal of the group was and still is to provide the Choctaw and eastern Oklahoma county areas a physical therapy experience unlike anything they had previously experienced.

They strive to achieve this goal every day while providing a family-based atmosphere with evidence-based, individualized treatment programs.

Our highly experienced <a href="therapists.php">staff/owners</a> are well prepared to assist you with all your therapy needs.
